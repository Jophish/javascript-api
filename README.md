# Split JavaScript API
Split public API SDK for JavaScript language.

This SDK is designed to work with [Split](https://www.split.io), the platform for controlled rollouts. This SDK interacts with the application API for identifying traffic. If you are looking for the Split rollout SDK, it can be found on [Github](https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client) or through its [documentation](http://docs.split.io/docs/java-sdk-guide).

### Quick setup

For specific instructions on how to set up the JavaScript API refer to our [Detailed-README](Detailed-README.md) or our [official SDK documentation](http://docs.split.io/docs/sdk-overview).

### Commitment to Quality:

Split’s SDKs are in active development and are constantly tested for quality. Unit tests are developed for each SDK based on the unique needs of that language, and integration tests, load and performance tests, and behavior consistency tests are running 24/7 via automated bots. In addition, monitoring instrumentation ensures that these SDKs behave under the expected parameters of memory, CPU, and I/O.
